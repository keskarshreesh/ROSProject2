# ROSProject2
Making the Turtlebot follow a predefined trajectory

The trajectory is as follows:

1. From the start point, complete arc of a circle of diameter 1m, based on angle and angular speed entered by user.
2. Travel to the diametrically opposite point.
3. Travel the same angle in the opposite direction (clockwise/anticlockwise) as in point 1.
4. Stop, publish total distance travelled, distance between start and end points.

Made using ROS Kinetic-Kane for Turtlebot3.
